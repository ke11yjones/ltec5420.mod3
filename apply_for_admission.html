<p>Now that you’ve set your goals, chosen a major, and selected the schools that you potentially want to attend, now comes the final step…the application process. Applying for college for first time students can be confusing and stressful, thankfully as a returning student you already know most of what needs to be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The things that might be different as a returning/adult student is that you will need to provide income documentation for jobs you may have had or currently have. Also, you will need to submit transcripts from any and all colleges or universities you’ve attended previously so that the schools you are applying to can evaluate the coursework you’ve attempted and completed. The table below provides a broad overview of the application process.
