<p>There are so many schools, with so many different programs available that choosing the right one can be overwhelming. Some things that should be considered when researching possible schools are: cost, location, application fees, credit transfer, attendance options, social clubs, gpa requirements, probationary periods, and student ratings of professors and staff. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it is important to research as much as you can about potential schools, one aspect that is often over-looked is the personality of the school. Make sure the school you choose fits your personality as a student. For example, if you arenâ€™t a partier, you may not want to apply to a school that is notorious for having a party atmosphere. This might not be a big deal if you will be attending classes virtually, but if you plan to be on-campus this could be distracting. There are lot of aspects to consider before making a final decision, so take your time.
