<p> Choosing a major, or deciding where to focus your academic studies can be one of the most important decisions you make. Depending on your decision it could mean a relatively short time to completion or a significantly longer time. For example, students in pre-med or pre-law programs understand that their studies will automatically continue far beyond the undergraduate level. So in addition to the added time for studying, there is also the added expense of more coursework, labs, conferences, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way that may help in choosing a major is to consider jobs that you may have held during your time away from school. Were there jobs that you really liked, what aspects of those jobs did you like the most? Thinking about prior jobs and activities can be a helpful jumping off point to picking your major, or steering you away from programs that donâ€™t fit your interests and future career plans.
